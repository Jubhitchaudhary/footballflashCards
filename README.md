## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While developing the app, challenges arose in managing state transitions for smooth flipping animations and ensuring UI consistency. Centralizing text alignment within the card required meticulous CSS adjustments. Additionally, synchronizing functionality between the "Next Card" button and resetting the card's state posed complexities, demanding precise coordination for optimal user experience.
